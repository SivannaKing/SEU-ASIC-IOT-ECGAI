# SEU-ASIC-IOT-ECGAI
Arrhythmia Detection Using Algorithm and Hardware Co-design for Neural Network Inference Accelerators


## Background
---
The popularization of automatic arrhythmia diagnosis equipment system is helpful to detect the early symptoms of arrhythmia and help people prevent cardiovascular diseases. Nowadays, most of them are machine learning algorithms based on pattern recognition. However, these algorithms have low generalization ability and can't be well applied to a large number of arrhythmia patients. Deep neural network (DNN) has been gradually popularized because of its ability to learn more advanced features from data, showing better generalization ability and robustness. However, DNN/CNN still has some problems that need to be solved urgently, such as the model derivation process consumes a lot of energy and the storage of the model requires a lot of memory space. Therefore, the research of intelligent heart rate detection system with higher energy efficiency has great application prospects in clinical diagnosis, health monitoring and other fields.
