The following pages contain notes and statistics that describe the contents of
each record.
The leads used for the upper and lower signals are given for each record
immediately following the record number.
Beat counts are given for the first five minutes of each record and
the remainder of the record (the AAMI-defined ``learning'' and ``test''
periods, respectively).
Note that the totals include two types of non-beats (blocked APCs and
ventricular flutter waves) for those few records in which they occur.
The total duration of each record is 30 minutes and 5.556 seconds;  durations
noted below are rounded to the nearest second, and may not sum to exactly
30:06 because of accumulated rounding error.
Heart rates are given in beats per minute measured over 3 R-R intervals.
