\fB\s12TABLES OF BEATS AND RHYTHMS\s10\fP


.PP
The following pages contain tables that summarize the contents of the
database.
These tables duplicate some of the contents of the previous
section (Notes), to which reference should be made for more details.
The first two tables list the beat types and rhythms for
each half-hour record in its entirety.  The last two tables show the
same information, but for the AAMI-defined ``test periods'' only
(i.e., excluding the first five minutes of each record).
.PP
The column headings for the beat tables show the AHA annotation codes
(N, V, F, E, P, Q, and O) above the symbols used for the database annotations
elsewhere in this book.
A complete list of these symbols, as well as the abbreviations used as
the column headings for the rhythm tables, may be found on page viii.
.PP
The beat tables show the number of beats of each type in each record.
The rhythm tables show the total duration of each rhythm observed in each
record in minutes and seconds (rounded to the nearest second).
